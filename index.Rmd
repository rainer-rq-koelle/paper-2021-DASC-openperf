# Abstract  {-=""}

The COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use,
sharing, and distribution of data on a global basis. Higher levels of
transparency were achieved with continual updates of pandemic related
information. The air transportation sector -- while by definition an information
rich industry -- is a notable exception. While different organizations offered
aggregated data on air traffic developments on national or airport level,
complementary data on air traffic movements for further analysis are not
available publicly. This creates a deadlock between addressing the societal
needs of monitoring how aviation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and
addresses the aspirational environmental goals. This paper investigates the
feasibility of utilizing open data for the operational performance monitoring
at airports. The exploratory work focusses on a subset of the indicators
proposed under ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan used to assess the operational
performance in the arrival phase. A novel approach to characterize and assess
the arrival flow management and level of traffic synchronization is presented. This
will allow to evaluate on-going air traffic recovery and identify operational
bottlenecks. The study is performed as a use-case analysis for three major
European airports by comparing the observed performance in the months of March
and May for the successive years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results demonstrate
the general feasibility and utility of open data for operational performance
monitoring. The classical performance measure for the arrival flow are
determined based on the open trajectory data. A geospatial-temporal evaluation
support the tracking of traffic synchronisation effort. A higher level of
transparency therefore available to the interested public, policy
decision-makers and strategic planners with direct feedback on the recovery and
actual operational performance. The suitability of the traffic synchronization
measure and its parameterization requires further validation across a wider set
of airports and will be iteratively refined.

# Introduction

The COVID19 pandemic
shifted the focus and attention of political decision-makers and strategic
planers over the past year. The unprecedented decline of regional and
international air traffic poses challenges in terms of funding of the air
transportation system in general and planned air traffic management
modernization. While it is unclear how today's travel constraints and the
vaccine roll-out will play out, both airspace users and air traffic service
providers are committed to "build back better." This will include a higher
emphasis on operational excellence. Higher levels of operational efficiency are
considered to be enablers for reduced queueing, both in the airspace and on the
ground, and lower associated fuel burn and emissions. It will be essential to
ensure that with increasing traffic levels, inefficiencies are immediately
tracked and remedied.

Air transportation
services are by definition an information rich environment. However, today, the
access and availability of open data for the monitoring and validation of air
transport /air navigation system performance or related published results of
studies and research exercises is limited [1][2]. Within this context, crowd collected open
data gains a higher momentum and visibility. Opensky Network became a key
resource for open air transport data during the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Opensky Network provides a global
flight-by-flight record of observed tracks on a monthly basis for interested
researchers or practitioners [4]. For detailed studies, the associated
trajectory data can be accessed via the Network resources. There is an active
community establishing tools for the extraction and processing of the data.
Demonstrating the feasibility and utility of using an existing open data source
to assess the current air transportation system performance, and trace the
development of the performance levels with returning traffic demand is vital.

The paper follows a data-driven exploratory approach. Based on the
operational performance indicators promoted by ICAO, a performance monitoring
toolchain is developed building on the open air transport data. The public
availability of the data in a near real-time set-up ensures that independent
validation of observed operational performance is available to policy makers, strategic
planners, practitioners, and researchers. A novel traffic synchronization
oriented performance metric is developed. The metric aims to isolate
operational and airspace related dimensions or inefficiencies. The approach
will be presented as use-case analysis of three European airports that show
significant differences in traffic patterns and approach concepts. The analysis
of the arrival management techniques will support the evaluation of the
achieved performance levels in terms of ground-based or airspace
holding/queueing and delay absorption.
