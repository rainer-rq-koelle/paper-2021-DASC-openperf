# Building Back Better â€“ Democratisation of Performance Monitoring with Open Data

This repo is the work space for putting the paper together.
The paper will deal with measuring operational performance with open data to support decision-making during the COVID19 recovery phase. As traffic increases, it is likely that the system falls back to the "old normal".

It is also planned wrap the work into a distill webpage. But that will be left for the post paper-production.
